There are two versions of this pen:

Version 2:

This pen works by holding it and then pressing the trigger to write, it has 5 colours, White, Black, Red, Green and Blue. It also has a erase button at the end of the pen. 

To use the buttons you need to use your pointer, like you would with UI buttons.


Version 3 (Recomended version):

Similar to version two, but now has a new model which looks better, version 3 does not use any animations and uses method calls instead, version 3 is currently experimental so version 2 is recommended for now. Version 3 also has 8 colors, White, Black, Red, Green, Blue, Orange, Purple and Pink. 

To use the buttons you need to use your pointer, like you would with UI buttons.

Note: Version 1 is now obsolete and has been removed in new package versions.

How to upload:

Simply start a new project, import CVR's CCK and Import the Unity Package provided then upload.
