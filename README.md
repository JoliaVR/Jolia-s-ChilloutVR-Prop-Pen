There are two versions of this pen:

Version 1:
Has 4 colours Red, Green, White and Black, The pen keep writing unto you turn it off. It has a on and off buttons and a erase button. This version isn't great and was made in 30 minutes, I only include it because it is the original version.

Version 2:
This pen works by holding it and then pressing the trigger to write, it has 5 colours, White, Black, Red, Green and Blue. It also has a erase button at the end of the pen. 

To use the buttons you need to use your pointer, like you would with UI buttons.
